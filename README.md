# ConcentrationGameCS
 A game where you concentrate, but in C#. Built using the Monogame framework. This game, in its current state, is a solitaire version of the game "Concentration", where the goal is to match pairs of cards that share a color and number. 
 
 I hope to eventually add a multiplayer version, but that is a goal for the future as I am currently prioritizing clean game logic and then smooth animations and sound effects. Currently the main functionality including game logic, sprites, menu, and scoreboard are working as intended. In the future, I will add different modes (time based, multiplayer, etc) and a high score saving functionality.

 This is my first time making a game, so the architecture of the project is a little rough around the edges, however it has been a great learning experience so far. It has become clear to me that starting with a well planned architecture for a project is essential to smooth development down the road. I also did my best to implement OOP principles by encaspulating logic and using inheritance to my advantages when designing the structure of the game.
